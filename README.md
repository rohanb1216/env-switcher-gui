* Unit tests with asserts

# TODO
* build the GUI using [wxPython](http://zetcode.com/wxpython/introduction/)
* package using [pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki), maybe following the [tutorial](http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2010/08/10/a-pyinstaller-tutorial-build-a-binary-series/)
