# Standalone desktop application

## Installation

You may install the `envswitch` application using the installers or the distribution archives provided in the [releases](https://github.com/smarie/env-switcher-gui/releases/) page. 

Select the distribution adapted to your computer, and simply install or extract in the folder of your choice. Note that for windows you have two choices: a MSI installer or a simple ZIP file to extract anywhere. 

## GUI

Once the application is installed/extracted, start envswitch from the main executable file (`envswitch_gui`) in the installation folder. 

On windows, if you used the MSI installer a desktop shortcut is available. On windows also, for debugging purposes, an alternate launcher is available as `envswitch_gui_debug`, so as to have the possibility to see the execution logs in a terminal.

At first launch the application will ask you for a configuration file. You may wish to download one from [here](./network_config.yml) and possibly adapt it to your needs. Also see [Usage](./index#usage)

## CLI

The commandline utility is available in the same folder, it is named `envswitch`.
